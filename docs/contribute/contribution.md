# Contributing to the project

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/stefro/laravel-lang-country).

::: warning Adding new features
To prevent disappointment, please open an issue to discuss your feature before you start coding. We can then discuss if
it's a good fit for the package before you put in the effort of creating a PR.

## Pull Requests

- [PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md)
  Fix the formating of your code with `composer format`.

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests, we have 100% code coverage. You can run the
  tests with `composer test` or `composer test:fast` (parallel testing). And you can check the coverage
  with `composer test:coverage`.

- Make sure all your code is **typed**. We have 100% type coverage. You can check the type coverage with
  `composer type:check`.
-
- **Document any change in behaviour** -You can find all the files for documentation in de `/docs` directory.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs
  is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make
  multiple intermediate commits while developing,
  please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages)
  before submitting.

**Happy coding**!
