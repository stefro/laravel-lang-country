## [2.1.0] - 2020-05-05

### Added

- LangCountryData.php : I've added 7 new properties to each file to distinguish between `language name`
  and `country name`. I have also added a `_local` option so the app can use the localised translation. I have also
  include the country's official currency too.

* `country_name` Added a default name of the country the app's primary demographic (e.g. `Spain`)
* `country_name_local` Added a localized name of the country in the language of this file (e.g. `EspaÃ±a`)
* `currency_code` Added the ISO-4217 code for this country's primary/official currency (e.g. `USD`)
* `currency_symbol` Added a default symbol for this country's primary/official currency (e.g. `$`)
* `currency_symbol_local` Added a localized symbol for this country's primary/official currency (e.g. `US$`)
* `currency_name` Added a default name for this country's primary/official currency (e.g. `Dollar`)
* `currency_name_local` Added a localized name for this country's primary/official currency (e.g. `US Dollar`)

- laravel-lang-country.php : Included the full ISO-3166 list of countries as new `locale` options to the `allowed`
  array. This will make it simpler to enable/disable locales as they become available.
- 2018_04_29_074240_add_lang_country_column_to_users_table.php : Added a char limit of `5` to the `lang_country` column.
- langCountry.php : Added methods to return the data files new parameters.

* Added countryName()
* Added countryNameLocal()
* Added currencyCode()
* Added currencySymbol()
* Added currencySymbolLocal()
* Added currencyName()
* Added currencyNameLocal()
